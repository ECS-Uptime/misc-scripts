This file assumes that you have NTP and NTPSTAT running on your machine. 
You can open a terminal and type 'ntp' at the command prompt. If they are not installed, the directions will be supplied in the notification



If NTP or NTPSTAT are not present, you can install it with the following:

sudo apt-get install ntp


sudo apt-get install ntp

stat

If, for any reason NTP causes an issue it can be removed with:

sudo apt-get purge ntp
sudo apt-get purge ntpstat



To run the script, download the zip file and extract it in your download directory. You can also download n]and extract the files directly in your terminal with the following:

Move 'drift-test' to /etc/cron.daily

sudo mv drift-test /etc/cron.daily



Move 'ntp.conf' to /etc/


sudo mv ntp.conf /etc

You may need to ensure the 'drift-test' file is executable:

sudo chmod +x /etc/cron.daily



This will run the script 'drift-test' as a daily cron job. The actual time that the script is run may vary according to your particular Ubuntu configuration. Changing the time your local cron jobs run is beyond the scope of this instruction.



You can change the configuration of the drift test file by opening it a text editor. Instructions for changing the configuration are commented in the file.


The script creates a repository of daily log files in your 'Home' directory called /driftlogs. This is where you can view the clock drift log reports.



Have fun!
